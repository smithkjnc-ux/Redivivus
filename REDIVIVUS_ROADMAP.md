> **RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS:**
> - New session fix entry? → `docs/REDIVIVUS_FIXES.md`
> - New planned feature / backlog item? → `docs/REDIVIVUS_FEATURES.md`
> - Architecture change / design rule? → `docs/REDIVIVUS_ARCHITECTURE.md`

*Last updated:* May 29, 2026 — Fix: cloudClassify no longer swallows errors; fallbackClassify now fires correctly (Session 11CX)

## Recent Sessions (last 3 — full entries in `docs/REDIVIVUS_FIXES.md`)

### Session 11CX — May 29, 2026: Fix cloudClassify Error Swallowing
- All classify API failures silently returned `question` — fallbackClassify in classifyIntent never fired
- "add a speed boost power-up" → Groq Q&A instead of build pipeline (found during test)
- Fix: removed try/catch from cloudClassify; errors now propagate to classifyIntent's fallback handler
- fallbackClassify correctly returns `build` for imperative verbs — pipeline now triggers on API failure

### Session 11CV — May 29, 2026: Similar Code Finder
- Worker had no awareness of similar logic in other project files — would reimplement existing functions
- New `similarCodeFinder.ts`: sync regex extraction + cheap AI relevance filter → up to 4 matched snippets
- Injected as `EXISTING SIMILAR CODE` block in Worker prompt, between exports map and existing content
- Three-layer defense now: export names (prevention) + function bodies (context) + Guardian (detection)

### Session 11CU — May 29, 2026: Cross-Session Build Decision Memory
- Implicit decisions from back-and-forth ("ok, use JWT") were never stored across sessions
- Added `extractBuildDecisions` to `LearnedMemoryService` — reviews full conversation post-build
- Wired into `runPostBuildActions` non-blocking — every successful build feeds `learned.md`
- Complements existing `extractFacts` (mid-chat explicit preferences) — now both paths are covered

## Active Next Steps
> Full backlog in `docs/REDIVIVUS_FEATURES.md`
- [ ] **Vault sync command** — wire `vaultCloudSync.ts` to `redivivus.syncVaultToCloud` palette command
- [ ] **Live Preview** — `▶ Preview` tab with device toggle (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] **Community vault** — admin approval flow for submitted patterns

## Routing: Where to Write

```
Made a code change this session?
  → docs/REDIVIVUS_FIXES.md  (add a table row)

Planning a future feature?
  → docs/REDIVIVUS_FEATURES.md  (add to backlog)

Changed a design rule or architecture decision?
  → docs/REDIVIVUS_ARCHITECTURE.md

Completed one of the active next steps above?
  → Update the checkbox here AND add entry to REDIVIVUS_FIXES.md
```
