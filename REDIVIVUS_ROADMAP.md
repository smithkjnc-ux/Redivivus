*Last updated:* Jun 4, 2026 — Session 16N: fixed duplicate chat panel when clicking "X Close Project" button — the button used raw `workbench.action.closeFolder` which bypassed the synchronous marker, so `wasProjectClosedRecently()` returned false and the auto-open timer created a second panel. Added dedicated `redivivus.closeProject` command that writes the marker first. Session 16M: fixed Python builds with non-conventional filenames (e.g. `calculator.py`) showing "Click Run" guidance but no Run button — `detectRunCommand` now falls back to a `.py` file with a `__main__` guard or the sole `.py` file, matching `detectPostBuildInfo`. Session 16k: fixed EVERY window reload spawning a duplicate chat tab (auto-open timer raced the serializer's async import; deserialize now re-checks _instance after the await). Session 16i: fixed "close the project" opening a DUPLICATE chat tab + stale dashboard (async userClosedProject flag lost the reload race → synchronous marker file in closeMarker.ts; deserialize idempotent + auto-open fallback guarantee exactly one launcher). Session 16h: fixed "close the project" hanging on "Closing project..." (spinner never reset). Session 16g: Supervisor (Claude) attribution fixed end-to-end (usage dashboard, byline, build history now show the Supervisor+Worker split instead of hardcoded "solo").

## Recent Sessions (last 3 — full entries in `docs/REDIVIVUS_FIXES.md`)

### Session 16 — Jun 3, 2026: Adaptive Blueprint Completion
- AI infers all 5 W's from any build request (confident/assumed/unknown per field)
- Confirmation card shown before every new project build — user sees assumptions before a line is written
- Only asks about genuine unknowns; confident/assumed fields are read-only (but editable via "Change something")
- Fallback: if inference fails, proceeds to direct build uninterrupted

### Session 14 — Jun 3, 2026: Build UX, AI Transparency, Auto-Continuation, Bug Prevention
- **AI breakdown card:** Every build result now shows "AI Used" with friendly model name (e.g. "Claude Haiku 4.5"), plain-English role ("Built your project"), and token count. Replaced technical jargon (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `Solo Builder`, pills) with readable one-liner per AI
- **Live code streaming on main build:** `chatPanelBuildRunner.ts` now accumulates chunks into a live code block — same real-time view previously only available on edits/fixes
- **Auto-continuation on token limit:** `cloudBuildClientAI.ts` detects `finish_reason: length/max_tokens` per provider (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, xAI, Kimi) and automatically continues up to 3 times — no truncated files, no user intervention needed. `streamingProviders.ts` + `routingTypes.ts` updated to propagate `truncated` flag
- **Duplicate panel on project close fixed:** `workbench.action.closeFolder` caused window reload → second `activate()` → auto-open timer fired with `currentPanel=false` → duplicate tab. Fix: set `redivivus.userClosedProject` flag in `globalState` before close; auto-open timer checks and skips if set
- **Static validators (Checks 8 & 9):** `codeValidator.ts` now catches `const` array reassignment (auto-fixes to `let`) and `ctx.translate(0,0)` used as transform reset (auto-fixes to `ctx.setTransform(1,0,0,1,0,0)`) — both are AI-generated runtime crash patterns
- **Web:** "PapaJoe Smith" name fix on homepage. All changes deployed to Cloudflare

### Session 13 — Jun 1, 2026: Full Audit, Security Fixes, Auth Repair, Sidebar, Polish Prompt
- **Windows auth fixed end-to-end:** `signIn.ts` now opens `redivivus.dev/auth/ide` (not `redivivus-backend`); `auth/ide/route.ts` uses forwarded host headers; `auth/callback` same fix; login page GitHub OAuth now hits registered domain
- **Security:** Removed hardcoded CF + GH tokens from `release.sh` / `nightly-release.sh` — moved to `~/.bashrc`, scripts guard with `${VAR:?not set}`; both scripts source `~/.bashrc` for cron compatibility
- **`makeTimeout` bug fixed:** Custom timeout errors now set `err.name = 'TimeoutError'` so catch branch actually matches
- **Shell injection fixed:** `gitAutoCommitService.ts` switched to `execFileSync('git', ['commit', '-m', msg])` — no shell injection via backticks or `$()`
- **Port validation fixed:** `auth/ide/route.ts` now validates `1024 ≤ port ≤ 65535`
- **Sidebar `New Project` button fixed:** Was calling `redivivusSidebar.focus` (no-op) — now opens chat and calls `showNewProject()`
- **`Work Log` / `Dead Ends` buttons fixed:** No longer silently no-op when not initialized; auto-open chat panel instead of requiring it pre-open
- **Polished build prompt:** `buildPipeline.ts` Rule 9 now mandates gradient bg, styled score panel, Web Audio, animated overlay, localStorage HS, responsive layout by default for all game builds
- **Reports archive:** Fixed/wontfix reports hidden by default in admin panel; new `archived (N)` tab shows them on demand
- **`.dockerignore` fixed:** `.wrangler` (1.1GB), `.open-next`, `.dev.vars` added — Fly deploys now send ~2MB context instead of 1.17GB
- **Auto-open explorer fixed:** Cloud build path now auto-opens workspace after result card renders (500ms delay + `pendingBuildComplete` rescue)
- **`applySurgicalEdits` fallback now logs a warning** when silently falling back to full rewrite

### Session 11DX — May 31, 2026: AbortSignal Hang Fix — Indefinite Spinner Freeze
- `AbortSignal.timeout()` unreliable in Electron; replaced with `Promise.race` + `makeTimeout` on plan/build/complete fetches
- Split `cloudBuildClient.ts` (201 → 172 lines) by extracting `executeClientAI` + `createFetchWithTimeout` to new `cloudBuildClientAI.ts`
- Removed `updateWorkspaceFolders` from `processBuildResults` — it was restarting the extension host mid-build in multi-root workspaces, killing the result card before it rendered
- Stale working messages now filtered from `saveConversation` so they don't resurrect after host restarts
- Report button redesigned: in-IDE WebviewPanel with category + text + image upload + AI debug prompt generation (no more GitHub browser redirect dialog)

### Session 11DF — May 29, 2026: Build UX — Auto-reload, Game Quality, Result Card
- Removed forced `vscode.openFolder` after new-project builds — result card already has "Open Project" button; auto-reload fired before user could read anything
- Local fallback SYSTEM prompt now explicitly requires fully playable games (event handlers, game state, win conditions)
- Local fallback narration now shows Builder/Cloud/Cost clearly

### Session 11DE — May 29, 2026: Auto vs Guided Build Modes
- Renamed `'direct'`/`'plan'` → "Auto"/"Guided" across all UI (popover, badge, launcher cards, empty state)
- Added `redivivus.buildMode: "auto" | "guided"` VS Code setting — persists mode across sessions
- Pre-loads setting in message router so mode is applied from first message
- Guided interview: all 5 W questions rewritten (more detailed), style follow-up added, task string improved

### Session 11DD — May 29, 2026: Cloud Build Local Fallback (5xx → Local AI Build)
- Cloud `/build` returns 500 (server framework crash, empty body — unfixable from client)
- Solution: on `status >= 500`, call `runLocalBuild()` — builds using user's own AI keys directly
- `cloudBuildClient.ts` was 291 lines → split into 3 files (170 / 62 / 129)
- New: `cloudBuildResultProcessor.ts`, `cloudBuildLocalFallback.ts`

## Active Next Steps
> Full backlog in `docs/REDIVIVUS_FEATURES.md`
- [ ] **Vault sync command** — wire `vaultCloudSync.ts` to `redivivus.syncVaultToCloud` palette command
- [ ] **Live Preview** — `▶ Preview` tab with device toggle (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] **Community vault** — admin approval flow for submitted patterns
